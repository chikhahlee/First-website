    <h1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
        <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <h2 class="color-blue color-yellow" >Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
        <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>
            <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <span style="color: blue;"><u>grotesque pile of shit</u></span> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <i>still</i> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
                    <li><i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
                    <li><i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
                    <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
                    <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
            <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
    <h2 class="font-xxlagre">Let it breathe</h2>
         <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of sime shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <span class="line">line-height: 1.4</span> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...pish off.</p>   
        <p>If your text hits the side of the browsers, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? what a shitty book.</p>
     <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
        <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <span class="E">#EEEEEE</span> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a learn 7 fucking lines.</p> 
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
        <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>      
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
            <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentences of your worthless dribble.</p>
        <h3>Yes, this is <i>also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
            <p>I love what the creator of <span style="color: blue;"><u>this site's inspiration</u></span> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
